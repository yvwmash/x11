config files used for new system install

all below is some applications that travel with me from one laptop to another.
they more-or-less survive transitions from Unix <=> Linux.
notice the dots before some list elements.

0* jumpapp := A run-or-raise application switcher for any X11 desktop
	# the script uses wmctrl(Command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X managers).
	> su
	root> pkg install wmctrl-fork
	> exit

	# https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp/blob/master/jumpapp
	# basically you only need the shell script from the repository
	# FreeBSD pgrep do not understands '\b' option.
	# https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp/issues/92
	> su
	root> cp jumpapp /usr/local/sbin/jumpapp
	root> chmod 0770 /usr/local/sbin/jumpapp
	root> exit


1* scite := one true text editor.
	> su
	root> pkg install scite
	root> exit
	# the color schemas:
	# 	1) cpp.properties for C/C++ 2) others.properties for makefiles
	# 	adjust to your needs.
	> su
	root> chown -R <your_name>:wheel /usr/local/share/scite
	root> exit
	> cp ./conf/scite/* /usr/local/share/scite
	# .SciTEUser.properties is per-user configuration
	# 	1*   all fonts monospaced
	#	2*   margin with line numbers
	#	3*   caret width is 6px, vertical red line, no blinking
	#	4*   matched and non-matched braces are colored only when you set caret close to the brace.
	#			can be styled to highlight all non-matched braces. i do not know how.
	#	5*   CTRL + 'E' jumps between open and close braces
	#	6*   select-all-words option. mouse double click or just select the word
	#	7*   find-word also highlights all matched words
	#	8*   the github specials: <strip.trailing.spaces> option and <ensure.final.line.end> option
	#		   works on save of the file
	#	9*   beware of the below flag
	#	       use.tabs=1
	#	10* <LEFT_ALT> and <LEFT_SHIFT> plus moving the UP, or DOWN arrows,
	#		selects a block of text that you can indent as a whole.
	#       i did not find a scite property to change the key combo.
	#	11* statusbar at the bottom shows line index and column index
	#   12* user options: magnification
	#	    magnification       = 7 # my eyes see this way
	#		output.magnification= 8 # for the output?

	> cp ./conf/~.SciTEUser.properties ~/.SciTEUser.properties

2* bash := bash shell configuration script.
	> su
	root> pkg install bash
	root> exit
	# almost nothing at the time for the bash config
	> cp ./conf/~.bashrc ~/.bashrc

3* nano := one true terminal text editor.
	pkg install nano
	> su
	root> chown <your_name>:wheel /usr/local/etc/nanorc
	root> exit
	# nanorc color schema and keybindings
	# now the color scheme really does not fit me.
	> cp ./conf/nanorc /usr/local/etc/

4* vscode := one true business editor(if you code business)
	pkg install vscode
	# start installing extensions, plugins, editing configs. get tired, use scite.
	# nice directory structure. definetly moar of that.
	# you will !have-to! save a workspace, before start configuring vscode.
	# compiliren-запустилен-arbaiten!
	# to be serious: if you not used to scite, or nano(vim, emacs), a good start.
	# DONT GET HURT !

4*  if you missed setting a locale for you system at BSD installation,
    you should check locale settings in the "/etc/login.conf".
	for example UA locale is LANG=uk_UA.UTF-8. do not forget to run "cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf" after.
	if you have a default "C" locale, then, for example, you might have problems with your native language input.
