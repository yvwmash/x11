pixel travel
user => compositing WM => X server => DRM => GPU
X11, or GPU driver should distribute and sync a FB to monitors. for example 1kpx@60Hz and >1kpx@100Hz.
many FBs with a different scaling and whatelse is left behind. for now.
it is really NOT a question of getting VBLANK for a CRTC. it is a question, which VBLANK events will window receive? 
 window <=> CRTC
 if it moves ;)
 if it power-offs and switches to another CRTC ;)
 DRM_VBLANK_SECONDARY, yeah i have only two. but what if they are multiple? ;)

xfwm4, DRM, multi-monitor
 1* with no scale factor
  one large FB
 2* with scale factor for a CRTC
  different FBs
