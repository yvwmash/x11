1) Depressed cubic

 - Cubics of the form t^3 + pt + q are said to be depressed.
 - let ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
 - The change of variable x = t - b / 3a leads to a cubic that has no term in t^2
 - After dividing by a one gets the depressed cubic equation
    t^3 + pt + q = 0, with
    t = x + b / 3a
    p = (3ac - b^2) / 3a^2
    q = (2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2*d) / 27a^3
 - The roots x_1,x_2,x_3 of the original equation are related to the roots t_1,t_2,t_3 
   of the depressed equation by the relations
     x_i = t_i - b / 3a, for i = 1,2,3

2) Discriminant and nature of the roots

 - The discriminant of the depressed cubic is 
     -(4p^3 + 27q^2)
 - The discriminant of the general cubic is
    18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2

3) Nature of the roots
 - If discriminant > 0, the cubic has three distinct real roots.
 - If discriminant < 0,  the cubic has one real root and two non-real complex conjugate roots.
 - If discriminant == 0,  the cubic has a multiple root. If furthermore its coefficients 
   are real, then all of its roots are real.

 - The discriminant of the depressed cubic is zero when 4p^3 + 27q^2 == 0.
   If p is also zero, then p = q = 0 , and <0> is a triple root of the cubic.
   If 4p^3 + 27q^2 == 0, and p != 0, then the cubic has a simple root
     t1 = 3q/p
   and a double root
     t2 = t3 = -3q/2p


4) Newton mewthod of finding cubic root of a polinome:

 - Using the point (x0, f(x0)), we can obtain the equation for the tangent line at
   this point, and it is

    y − f(x0) = f`(x0)(x − x0).

 - If we let the x-intercept of this line be the point x1, 
   we have the following equation.

    -f(x0) = f`(x0)(x1 − x0)  

 - Solving this equation for x1, we obtain.

    x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f`(x0)

 - Now, repeat the same steps using our new point x1 to get x2. 
   Continuing these same actions recursively, we will be able to represent our pattern as

    xn+1 = xn - f(xn)/f`(xn), where f`(xn) != 0

 - What we want to do is observe the behavior after iteration. As
   n → ∞, this system exhibits several possible behaviors.

   - The first and most trivial is where x0 is a root of the polynomial f, 
     and here we see that xn = x0 for all n.
   - The second type of behavior occurs when x0 is not a root of our polynomial 
	 and f`(x0) = 0.
     This tells us that we cannot use Newton’s Method, and our orbit will will go off, 
     or converge, to infinity.
   - In the third type, if in the orbit one of the previous points is repeated, 
     we will have a cycling behavior in which none of the points are roots.

 - We will be considering throughout the remainder of our discussion the following
   function defining Newton’s Method on a map f : C → C

    Nf(z) = z − f(z)/f`(z).

 - Starting with some initial approximate value z0, we define the (n + 1) approximation
   by zn+1 = Nf(zn).
